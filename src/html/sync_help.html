      <h3>Advantages of Synchronization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automatic vocabulary backup to Google Drive, so you don't have to worry about manual
          backups any more
        </li>
        <li>
          Vocabulary synchronization between different Words Discoverer extensions (if you use this
          extension in multiple browsers)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
        If you enable Google Drive synchronization, your vocabulary will be automatically backed up
        to your Google drive each time you add or remove words from it. Maximum sync frequency is
        once per 30 minutes, although you can always press "Sync now" button to force manual
        synchronization.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you use Words Discoverer extension in multiple browsers, their vocabularies will be
        synchronized through your Google Drive.
        <br />
        <br />
        Words Discoverer files will be saved to the "Words Discoverer Sync" folder in your Google
        Drive root directory. Your vocabulary can be found in "japanese_vocabulary.txt" file.
        ".japanese_vocabulary.backup" is a technical file which stores all added and deleted words.
        <br />
        <br />
        To stop synchronization press the "Stop Sync" button which will appear once synchronization
        is enabled.
        <br />
        <br />
        If extension icon shows red "err" badge, it means that synchronization has stopped due to an
        error. In this case you can try to press "Synchronize Now" button again or, if it doesn't
        help, try to restart the browser.
        <br />
        <br />
        The most convenient way to view your vocabulary in google drive without downloading is to
        use "Preview" button in the google drive file menu, see the screenshot below:
